                        <p>
                           Hi Akii! It’s crazy how someone you meet online—someone you didn’t even know existed a little while ago—can suddenly become a big part of your thoughts. I don’t know how it happened so fast, but every conversation we’ve had feels easy and real, like I’ve known you longer than I actually have. I don't now, Akii eh, but one things for sure I fell safe around you. I want you to know that I genuinely appreciate the effort and sincerity you’ve shown me.
I can see how much you care, and that doesn’t go unnoticed Akii. It might have happened quickly, but I enjoy our conversations and the connection we’re building. I’m not here to play games or waste anyone’s time and I promise na I won't hurt you like they did. OKay akii?? I lovee youu!         </p>
